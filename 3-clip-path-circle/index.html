    <p>
      I've tried the new moon tilted in the air
      Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster
      As you might try a jewel in your hair.
      I've tried it fine with little breadth of luster,
      Alone, or in one ornament combining
      With one first-water start almost shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put it shining anywhere I please.
      By walking slowly on some evening later,
      I've pulled it from a crate of crooked trees,
      And brought it over glossy water, greater,
      And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow,
      The color run, all sorts of wonder follow...
